# AirbnbPropertyBookingsAnalysis

This repository contains a python notebook with the code used for the analysis of the attractiveness of the Airbnb properties in Seattle. The data used is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). A summary of the analysis is available in the following [blogpost](https://medium.com/p/17cea846c019/). 

In general, only standard python libraries (pandas, numpy, and matplotlib) have been used. For two of the graphics (location) *mpl_toolkits.basemap* is used. For these two graphics the shape files containing geodata for Seattle is needed. It is available in the Zip_Codes-shp folder.
